I have explored the data to predict whether customer would accept coupons or not. I have mostly divided the data for bar coupon and coffee coupon. Here is my findings ----  

A) COUPON ---> BAR

1) The acceptance rate is higher for customers who went to bar more than 3 times a month compared to others,
2) The acceptance rate is higher for customers who went to bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25,
3) The acceptance rate is higher for the drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid,


B) COUPON -----> COFFEE
1) There is a large proportion of coffee coupons accepted than bar coupons,
2) The acceptance rate of coffee coupons is higher among customers who went to coffee house more than 3 times a month,
3) The acceptance rate is higher among the customers whose age is greater than 25.

Here is the link to the jupyter notebook where I have done my data exploration.
